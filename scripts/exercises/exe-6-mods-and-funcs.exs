# Iâ€™m thinking of a number between 1 and 1000...
# The most efficient way to find the number 
# is to guess halfway between the low and high numbers
# of the range. If our guess is too big, then the answer 
# lies between the bottom of the range and one less than our guess. 
# If it is too small, then the answer lies between one 
# more than our guess and the end of the range.

# Code this up. 
# Your API will be guess(actual, range), where range is an Elixir range.
