###I am reading the following books:###

Programming Elixir by Dave Thomas

> <http://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir>

Introducing Elixir by Simon St. Laurent & J. David Eisenberg

> <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do>

Both are well written and rather enjoyable, if you don't know Erlang purchase a copy of each.

Etudes found here: <http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001642>
